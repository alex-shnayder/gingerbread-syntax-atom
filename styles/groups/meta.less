// Meta

// The meta scope is generally used to markup larger parts of the document.
// E.g., the entire line which declares a function would be meta.function
// and the subsets would be storage.type, entity.name.function,
// variable.parameter, etc. and only the latter would be styled.
// Sometimes the meta part of the scope will be used
// only to limit the more general element that is styled,
// most of the time meta scopes are however used in scope selectors
// for activation of bundle items.
// For example in Objective-C there is a meta scope
// for the interface declaration of a class and the implementation,
// allowing the same tab-triggers to expand differently, depending on context.

.meta {

  // Braces and delimiters
  &.brace,
  &.braces.function,
  &.delimiter {
    color: @_punctuation;
  }
}
